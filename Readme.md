# Interview Experiences

I applied to various companies for a full-time role (mostly in systems), and here are some of my `On-Campus @ IITD` as
well as `Off-Campus` Online Assessment (OA) and Interview experiences:

- [Stripe](#stripe)  
- [Hudson River Trading](#hudson-river-trading)  
- [Squarepoint Capital](#squarepoint-capital)  
- [DRW](#drw)  
- [Graviton](#graviton)  
- [QuantBox](#quantbox)

## Stripe

### Online Assessment
It was a 60-minute test on HackerRank. The problem wasn't algorithmic, but rather implementation-heavy.
I had to parse a command string and execute the commands, which simulated transactions between users’ bank accounts.
It wasn't very difficult, but the implementation was fairly long.

### Phone Screening
The next round was a 45-minute phone screening on Zoom with one of the engineers.
This was a live coding round, which I could attempt either on my local IDE or in their HackerRank sandbox.

Again, it involved an implementation-based problem with 2–3 subparts. Each subpart built upon the previous one.

### Programming Round
This round had one programming question (with multiple subparts), which I attempted in C++.

### Bug-Squash Round
I was given access to an open-source C++ repository and asked to fix two bugs within an hour. I used a debugger and
breakpoints to trace and fix the issues.

### Manager Chat Round
This was a final, non-technical, 30-minute round with an Engineering Manager.  
Some of the questions I recall:
- A deep dive into my internship experience (both technical and non-technical)
- Questions about how I approached my project, its impact, and follow-ups
- My goals as a software engineer for the next two years
- A technically challenging past experience and how I handled it
- Why I believe Stripe is the right career fit for me

## Hudson River Trading  
**Role:** C++ Software Engineer

### Online Assessment  
A 90-minute online assessment on CodeSignal, consisting of four easy CP questions.

### Phone Screening  
A 45-minute in-depth systems interview, primarily on OS and C++.  
Questions included:
- Use of `inline` functions in C++: pros and cons
- `vector` vs `list`: trade-offs and internal details
- Internal working of `malloc`, demand paging, etc.
- How the kernel allocates memory to user processes
- System calls like `sbrk` and `mmap`

## Squarepoint Capital  
**Role:** C++ Software Engineer

### Online Assessment  
Two CP questions — one on two pointers (CF 1600 level) and the other was a tricky implementation problem.

### Technical Screening R1 (1 hour)
- First 10 minutes: resume deep dive and basic project discussion  
- Next 20 minutes: CS trivia (virtual memory, process management, page tables, real-time systems, TCP vs UDP, dangling pointers)  
- Last 30 minutes: live coding round on HackerRank  
  I had to debug a dummy `vector` implementation — missing destructor, needed a custom copy constructor, fixed memory leaks, added out-of-range checks, etc.

### Technical Screening R2 (1 hour)
- First 5–10 minutes: CV discussion  
- Then, questions on TCP's internal state machine handling  
- Given a code snippet, asked how many times constructors (copy/move/assignment) would be called  
- Code exercise related to `char**` pointers  
- Final 20 minutes: Live coding round

### Technical Screening R3 (1 hour)
- Given a thread-safe queue implementation and benchmark on HackerRank, I had to suggest some optimizations:  
- Some of the optimizations:
  - Replace copies with move semantics
  - Use a condition variable instead of busy waiting
  - Make the queue bounded
  - Use RAII for locking/unlocking
  - Discuss cache friendliness of the underlying container  
- Finished in ~45 minutes

## DRW

### Online Assessment  
Three C++ questions in 120 minutes. One involved finding a bug in a given code snippet; the other two were Leetcode medium-to-hard level.

### Technical Round  
A 1-hour interview with a senior engineer.  
I had to write pseudocode to serialize a `struct` in binary format and write it to a file.  
Follow-up questions included endianness and how to handle it.

## Graviton  
**Role:** Software Engineer

### Pen-and-Paper Test  
Two CP questions and two systems questions:  
- Implement concurrent transactions between two bank accounts using locks  
- Remove branching from a given code snippet  
The CP problems were roughly CF 1700 level.

### Technical Rounds  
2–3 rounds, each focused on CP questions.

---

## QuantBox

### Online Assessment  
15 CS fundamentals MCQs in 20 minutes.  
Followed by three non-CP C++ coding questions in 25 minutes.

### Technical Round  
A long, in-depth systems interview (3–4 hours) covering OS, C++, and parallel programming.  
Topics included:
- Smart pointer (`shared_ptr`) implementation  
- `String` class implementation  
- Memory pool implementation  
- Internal workings of virtual functions  
- Lock-free data structures (multi-threaded linked list, producer-consumer buffer)  
- Endianness detection  
- Virtual dispatch  
- Memory reordering (hardware/compiler level)  
- Lazy allocation and `malloc` internals  
- Spinlock and contention optimization  
- Read-Copy-Update (RCU)  
- And several open-ended follow-ups
